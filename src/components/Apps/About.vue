      My name is Adam and I live in Cracow, Poland. I'm a self-taught web
      developer, focusing mostly on the front end. I've graduated from Kielce
      University of Technology with Engineering degree in Surveying and
      Cartography. I've spent majority of my life working with computers in some
      form so I figured I might as well give this whole "programming" thing a
      go. Turns out I quite like it so I stuck with it until now - started about
      1.5 year ago. My main approach when building a website is to think outside
      the box. I never liked doing the same thing everyone else is doing.
