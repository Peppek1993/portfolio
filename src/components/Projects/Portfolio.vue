      Well, this is awkward.. But since you're already here - this is my
      portfolio! It was built entirely from scratch to make it look like a mix
      between Windows and MacOS. I've mostly used Vue and TailwindCSS with some
      other minor libraries. The inspiration for the design itself was partly
      borrowed from other websites, but the code and the approach on how to
      build it is entirely mine. I hope you like it and please don't hesitate to
      give me any feedback and/or point out any bugs you might've encountered.
      Cheers!
